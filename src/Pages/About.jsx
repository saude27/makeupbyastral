          <p className='text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-150'>
            My makeup artistry journey began as a passion for beauty during the ASUU strike in 2015, 
            when I was a 100-level student in my home country, Nigeria. <br />
            After attending a training, I initially hesitated to pursue a career as a makeup artist. <br />
            However, I continued to create beautiful looks for myself, my sisters, and friends at various events, 
            refusing to let doubt hold me back. Fast forward to 2023, I took a bold step by enrolling in an upgrade class. <br />
            Relocating to Australia that same year presented challenges, but I embraced the unfamiliarity with determination. <br />
            What started as a hobby transformed into a legitimate venture, leading to the registration of my business. <br />
            My passion for makeup, ignited in 2015, culminated in the official launch of my services in Australia in June 2025, 
            as I set out to inspire others with the art of beauty.
